# 202260_ITC205_Team3
A repository for Team 3 (Rishabh, Deepak, Toby) in the ITC205: Professional Programming Practice subject in Session 202260 at Charles Sturt University.

*** README ***

This zip file contains operational source code for Assignment 2 in the BRLS directory. 

Place the files contained in the 'src' directory in the project source folder of your chosen IDE.

The source code is arranged in a package structure which you should preserve. All package references (i.e. imports) are relative to the src directory.

Your task is to bring the supplied code into conformance with the provided code style guidelines (see separate file) - as a team.

You MUST break the coding task up according to the suggested work break down structure (see separate file). Furthermore you MUST process the entity classes in the first iteration and process the control and UI classes in the second iteration.

The aim of the code review process is to review updated code against the code style guidelines - nothing else.

All defects found must be identified individually.
Failure to rename an instance variable counts as a single defect.
Failure to rename a local (method) variable counts as a single defect in the method it is used.
Failure to rename a method counts as a single defect in the class it is declared. It is not a defect to use a defective method name in a referenced class, if that class was yet to be revised in the version of master from which the feature branch was formed.
